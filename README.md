# Welcome to the Hello-World CDK Python lambda GENERATOR project!

This project generates an AWS python lambda project with all the automation.

The goal is to: “make the right things easy”. (i.e. standardization)

Moreover this will increase both the speed and quality of our work.


[How do I use it?](https://useitc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CINO/pages/239009793/Hello-World+python+lambda)


## Historical
Here is the standard boilerplate that *cdk init sample-app --language python* generated:

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization process also creates
a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .venv directory.  To create the virtualenv
it assumes that there is a `python3` executable in your path with access to the `venv` package.
If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails, you can create the virtualenv
manually once the init process completes.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You can now begin exploring the source code, contained in the hello directory.
There is also a very trivial test included that can be run like this:

```
$ pytest
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add to
your requirements.txt file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
